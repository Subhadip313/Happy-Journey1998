West Bengal is the only state that
combines the triple travel thrills of the
mountains, the plains and the
coastline. Darjeeling, where the mist is
like a tantalizing curtain to the beauty
of the Kanchendzonga; Shanti
Niketan, the home of the 'poet'
Rabindra Nath Tag o r e ; the
Sunderbans, the largest estuarine
forest in the world; and Digha,
promising sun, sea, sand, surfing and
seafood! Calcutta, now renamed
Kolkata – the 'city of joy', has
overtones of fish, Marx and literature
in equal measures. This first city built
by the British was the earlier capital of
India, before shifting base to Delhi.
