Varanasi The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for
Hindus for ages. Often referred to as Benares, Varanasi is the oldest living city in
the world. These few lines by Mark Twain say it all:
"Benaras is older than history, older
than tradition, older even than legend
and looks twice as old as all of them put
together". Ganges is said to have its
origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and
in Varanasi. Some of the most
important temples of Varanasi are
Durga temple, Vishwanath temple,
Sankat Mochan temple, Tulsi Manas
temple and the Bharat Mata temple.
