As you all know every building has its own History and like wise the Public buildings
built by the British in Chennai City has now become historical monuments worthy of study.
Since it has survived for 100 years it has good claim to be called historical monument.
Beautiful buildings like Spencers and Moore Market cannot be rebuilt. Thanks to the
effort taken by the INTACH, Government and other Non Government bodies that the Senate
House is back in form. There are many buildings like the Royapuram, Railway Station,
National Art Gallery, Bharat Insurance building, Chepauk Palace Presidency College, Ripon
building, Government Fine Arts College etc, that cry for restoration. It is up to the Government
to restore these buildings to its former glory and it is the duty of the Citizen to see that no
damage is done to these buildings.
In this paper I have listed a brief history of the Historical Buildings in and around
Chennai in a chronological order. All the Buildings were designed by British Architects who
served as Consulting Architects to the British Government. I have arranged it in the following
order – Name of the building, period of construction, Name of the Architect, Design / style of
the building, Present condition and the last unit is a comparative study of similar buildings in
other British presidency towns.
