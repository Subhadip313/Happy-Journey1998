The lure of lush landscapes, the
exhilaration of having seen Leh – the
high-altitude desert, and the holy darshans
ofVaishno Devi – if there is a
heaven on earth, it is here, in Jammu&
Kashmir.Aparadise trying to regain its
rightful place on the tourism map after
the clouds of militancy slowly

<h3>SRINAGAR</h3> 
 Srinagar is a unique city, known for its
lakes – the Dal, Nagin and Anchar; for
its fabulous gardens – Shalimar and
Nishat; for the Shankaracharya temple
and for its mosques all awash in the
glorious splendour of nature that was

through a part of the city

These
floating homes on the Dal Lake and
Nagin Lake, are poetically
picturesque, and come with all modern
amenities. The Dal, Srinagar's largest
lake, has many of them in long rows,
some facing the Boulevard while
others are situated singly or in groups
of two or three. The houseboats here
require shikaras to go to and from
them. Stay in the Houseboats!<br>
